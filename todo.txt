TIMELINE

goals for today
- validate up until and including 1

monday pre meeting
- validate up until and including 4
- skeleton example -> synethtic images going from one spot to the next -> "data was messy/difficult to work with cause ...."

monday meeting
Answer:
- How good are the meshes/point clouds produced by the ZED camera? -> mesh of ruler, compare
- How good are the meshes/point clouds with less leaves? -> mesh of other view
- How good is the mask of the point cloud I produce? -> use a synthetic image (all white pixels except for some black to be masked), also compare with ideal

monday post meeting
- validate up until and including 6 + writing

tuesday pre meeting
- validate up until and including 7 + writing

tuesday post meeting
- revision



VALIDATION

0
- qualitative measurements on the accuracy of the point clouds rendered from the sdk from the svo files from the camera

1
- quantitative comparison of the images vs the visualization of the point clouds

2
- none

3
- visualizations from the jupyter notebook model files

4
- compare a visualization of the leaf masked in a picture (line in jupyter notebook model file) with a self made black and white image where the mask is black and everything else is white

5
- easy to visualize point cloud of scattered points -> a sphere, the mask will be a cylinder that cuts across the sphere ?? something like that
- visualize normal result

6
- randomize points that average out to an expected midline, verify it's that midline
- visualize normal result

7
- set a point cloud with two points that are obviously the furthest, compare known distance with calculated distance
- visualize normal result where two points are distinct colors that can be told apart
