TIMELINE

sunday
- validate up until and including 0

monday pre meeting
- validate up until and including 3
- skeleton example -> synethtic images going from one spot to the next -> "data was messy/difficult to work with cause ...."

monday meeting
Answer:
- How good are the meshes/point clouds produced by the ZED camera? -> mesh of ruler, compare
- How good are the meshes/point clouds with less leaves? -> mesh of other view
- How good is the mask of the point cloud I produce? -> use a synthetic image (all white pixels except for some black to be masked), also compare with ideal

monday post meeting
- validate up until and including 5 + writing

tuesday pre meeting
- validate up until and including 7 + writing

tuesday post meeting
- validate up until and including 8 + writing + revision



VALIDATION

0
- qualitative measurements on the accuracy of the point clouds rendered from the sdk from the svo files from the camera

ZED needs to be accurate at different distances
- show this through data
- show this through screenshots of pcs at different lifecycle of plants


1
- quantitative comparison of the images vs the visualization of the point clouds


2
- none

3
- visualizations from the jupyter notebook model files

4
- compare a visualization of the leaf masked in a picture (line in jupyter notebook model file) with a self made black and white image where the mask is black and everything else is white

5
- easy to visualize point cloud of scattered points -> a sphere, the mask will be a cylinder that cuts across the sphere ?? something like that
- visualize normal result

6
- randomize points that average out to an expected midline, verify it's that midline
- visualize normal result

-------------------

7
- set a point cloud with two points that are obviously the furthest, compare known distance with calculated distance
- visualize normal result where two points are distinct colors that can be told apart



-----

show comparison of segmented leave with depth image



________________________________________________________


add to other virtual environment being able to process open3d visualization
recreate virtual environments: model to just do model, other to do everything else, install zed sdk instead of docker contianer????? maybe not cause of cuda version and stuff



simplify validation, there should be one file that runs and does the work and maybe calls on the utils files instead of so many symbolic links?
