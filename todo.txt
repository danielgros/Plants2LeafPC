Specific
1 How good are the meshes/point clouds produced by the ZED camera? -> mesh of ruler, compare




1.5 How good are the meshes/point clouds with less leaves? -> mesh of other view
2 How good is the mask of the point cloud I produce? -> use a synthetic image (all white pixels except for some black to be masked), also compare with ideal

thesis: the goal of it is what i want it to be, not what it was in the beginning (reframe the goal if needed)

skeleton example -> synethtic images going from one spot to the next -> "data was messy/difficult to work with cause ...."
